      The game of uncertainty: Tossing a coin gives us a 50% chance of it
      landing heads and 50% chance landing tails, but until the coin lands we
      don't know what it will be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Each coin toss is an independent "event" and the outcome of the previous
      toss does not affect the probability of the next toss.

    <p>
      The game is simple: you flip a coin and complete the challenge. If you
      don't like the challenge, you can skip it and flip the coin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is played in turns. Each turn consists of flipping a coin and
      completing the challenge. If you don't like the challenge, you can skip it
      and flip the coin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game ends when you complete all the challenges or when you give up.
