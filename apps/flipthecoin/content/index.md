title: Simply â€“flip the coin

The game of uncertainty: Tossing a coin gives us roughly 50% chance of it
landing heads and 50% chance landing tails, but until the coin lands we
don't know what it will be!

Interestingly, real-world coin flips aren't always perfectly fair. Studies have
shown that a coin has about a 51% chance of landing on the same face it started
on. Factors like air resistance, the coin's weight distribution, and
even the mechanical motion of flipping can affect the outcome. For instance, a

(PDF) 2007 study by mathematician Persi Diaconis</a> found the
chances on landing the same face was 51% for natural coin tosses.

Theorically, a coin is fair and the outcome is random. But **in practice, it's not**.

Each coin toss is an independent "event" and the outcome of the previous
toss does not affect the probability of the next toss. But, as we described,
the real-world coin toss is not as fair as we'd like.

In flipthecoin.app, we try to make the coin toss as fair as possible
by introducing a component of randomness so it's non-deterministic. The game
cannot be rigged as easily.
