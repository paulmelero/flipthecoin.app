# About us

[FlipTheCoin.app](https://flipthecoin.app) is a simple web application that simulates coin flips. It was created by [Paul Melero](https://gnet.click) in 2025. The idea behind the app and the extension is to provide a fun and interactive way to learn about probability, randomness, statistics, the dangers of gambling, the ethics of video game development, physics, and the importance of making informed decisions, all while having fun, in a safe and controlled environment.

## Why this idea

Our main goal is to contribute to the silly web, the useless web<sup>1</sup>, the fun web, the educational web, the web that makes you think, the web that makes you laugh, the web that makes you question, the web that makes you learn, the web that makes you grow, the web that makes you better, the web that makes you worse, the web that makes you human.

In the meantime, I get to learn how to launch a product, one with little stakes.

The project is entirely independent-funded and self-sustained. We don't have any sponsors, investors, or partners. We don't have any ads, trackers, or cookies.

Please, refer to the [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service) for more information about how we handle your data.

## How to support us

If you like the app, please consider sharing it with your friends, family, and colleagues. You can also follow us on [Bsky](https://bsky.app/flipthecoin) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flipthecoinapp) for updates and news. You cal also sign up to receive the Newsletter and get information about the web and also small pills of statistics, probability, randomness, engineering, and more.

## Open source

The project is not open sourced for now, but I plan to do it in the future. I will also write technical articles about how the site is made both in this blog and in [my personal development blog](https://graficos.net/blog).
