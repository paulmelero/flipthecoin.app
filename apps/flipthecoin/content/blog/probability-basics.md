# Probability Basics

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a way of quantifying uncertainty and measuring the likelihood of different outcomes. In the context of coin flips, probability is used to determine the likelihood of the coin landing on **heads** or **tails**.

## The Basics

When we talk about probability, this is a mathematical concept that can be represented in a few different ways. The most common way to represent probability is as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. For example, if you flip a fair coin, the probability of it landing on heads is **1/2**, which is the same as **0.5**, or also **50%**. The three representations are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.

As we will see in [The Unexpected Statistics of Coin Flips blog post](https://flipthecoin.app/blog/the-unexpected-statistics-of-coin-flips), the probability of a coin landing is not exactly 50-50.
